== Coffee it Forward

Coffee it Forward is a web-application that allows students in the Masters of Digital Media Program at Ryerson University to reward each other by sending fun gifts, like coffee. 

It is a great way to interact with each other over the internet, and say "Thank you" simply by sending each other rewards. The features and usability of the app will be customized by the students in the MDM class.
